# A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

This app  runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

The planner displays the current day at the top of the calendar. There are time blocks that follow standard business hours of 9-5. Each time block is updated and colour coded based on on current hour to see whether tasks are due in the past, present or future. The user can click into a time block and enter an event and when the user clicks on the save button the tasks are saved into localstorage. Tasks are pulled from localstorage on page load which allows for tasks to persist on page reload.
